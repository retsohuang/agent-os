# Task Execution Rules

## Overview

Initiate execution of one or more tasks for a given spec.

<pre_flight_check>
  EXECUTE: @~/.agent-os/instructions/meta/pre-flight.md (use mcp__filesystem__read_text_file)
</pre_flight_check>

<process_flow>

<step number="1" name="task_assignment">

### Step 1: Task Assignment

Identify which tasks to execute from the spec (using spec_srd_reference file path and optional specific_tasks array), defaulting to the next uncompleted parent task if not specified.

<task_selection>
  <explicit>user specifies exact task(s)</explicit>
  <implicit>find next uncompleted task in tasks.md</implicit>
</task_selection>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Identify task(s) to execute
  DEFAULT: Select next uncompleted parent task if not specified
  CONFIRM: Task selection with user
</instructions>

</step>

<step number="2" subagent="context-fetcher" name="context_analysis">

### Step 2: Context Analysis

Use filesystem tools to gather minimal context for task understanding by always reading spec tasks.md, and conditionally reading @.agent-os/product/mission-lite.md, spec-lite.md, and sub-specs/technical-spec.md if not already in context.

<instructions>
  ACTION: Use filesystem tools to read required files:
    - USE: mcp__filesystem__read_text_file for mission-lite.md if needed
    - USE: mcp__filesystem__read_text_file for spec-lite.md if needed
    - USE: mcp__filesystem__read_text_file for technical-spec.md if needed
    - USE: mcp__filesystem__read_text_file for tasks.md
  PROCESS: File contents for context
</instructions>

<context_gathering>
  <essential_docs> - tasks.md for task breakdown
  </essential_docs>
  <conditional_docs> - mission-lite.md for product alignment - spec-lite.md for feature summary - technical-spec.md for implementation details
  </conditional_docs>
</context_gathering>

</step>

<step number="3" subagent="git-workflow" name="git_branch_management">

### Step 3: Git Branch Management

Use the git-workflow subagent to manage git branches to ensure proper isolation by creating or switching to the appropriate branch for the spec.

<instructions>
  ACTION: Use git-workflow subagent
  REQUEST: "Check and manage branch for spec: [SPEC_FOLDER]
            - Create branch if needed
            - Switch to correct branch
            - Handle any uncommitted changes"
  WAIT: For branch setup completion
</instructions>

<branch_naming>
  <source>spec folder name</source>
  <format>exclude date prefix</format>
  <example>
    - folder: 2025-03-15-password-reset
    - branch: password-reset
  </example>
</branch_naming>

</step>

<step number="4" name="task_execution_loop">

### Step 4: Task Execution Loop

Execute all assigned parent tasks and their subtasks using @~/.agent-os/instructions/core/execute-task.md instructions, continuing until all tasks are complete.

<execution_flow>
  LOAD @~/.agent-os/instructions/core/execute-task.md ONCE using mcp__filesystem__read_text_file
  LOAD @~/.agent-os/instructions/core/commit.md ONCE using mcp__filesystem__read_text_file

  FOR each parent_task assigned in Step 1:
    EXECUTE instructions from execute-task.md with: - parent_task_number - all associated subtasks
    WAIT for task completion
    UPDATE tasks.md status
    CHECK git status for uncommitted changes
    IF uncommitted changes exist:
      EXECUTE instructions from commit.md
      WAIT for commit completion
    ELSE:
      SKIP commit (no changes to commit)
    END IF
  END FOR
</execution_flow>

<loop_logic>
  <continue_conditions> - More unfinished parent tasks exist - User has not requested stop
  </continue_conditions>
  <exit_conditions> - All assigned tasks marked complete - User requests early termination - Blocking issue prevents continuation
  </exit_conditions>
</loop_logic>

<task_status_check>
AFTER each task execution:
CHECK tasks.md for remaining tasks
IF all assigned tasks complete:
PROCEED to next step
ELSE:
CONTINUE with next task
</task_status_check>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Load execute-task.md instructions once at start
  REUSE: Same instructions for each parent task iteration
  LOOP: Through all assigned parent tasks
  UPDATE: Task status after each completion
  CHECK: Git status for uncommitted changes after each task
  COMMIT: Execute commit.md process only if changes exist
  SKIP: Commit if no changes to commit
  VERIFY: All tasks complete before proceeding
  HANDLE: Blocking issues appropriately
</instructions>

</step>

<step number="5" subagent="test-runner" name="test_suite_verification">

### Step 5: Run All Tests

Use the test-runner subagent to run the entire test suite to ensure no regressions and fix any failures until all tests pass.

<instructions>
  ACTION: Use test-runner subagent
  REQUEST: "Run the full test suite"
  WAIT: For test-runner analysis
  PROCESS: Fix any reported failures
  REPEAT: Until all tests pass
</instructions>

<test_execution>
<order> 1. Run entire test suite 2. Fix any failures
</order>
<requirement>100% pass rate</requirement>
</test_execution>

<failure_handling>
<action>troubleshoot and fix</action>
<priority>before proceeding</priority>
</failure_handling>

</step>

<step number="6" name="roadmap_progress_check">

### Step 6: Roadmap Progress Check (Conditional)

Use filesystem tools to check @.agent-os/product/roadmap.md (if not in context) and update roadmap progress only if the executed tasks may have completed a roadmap item and the spec completes that item.

<conditional_execution>
<preliminary_check>
EVALUATE: Did executed tasks potentially complete a roadmap item?
IF NO:
SKIP this entire step
PROCEED to step 8
IF YES:
CONTINUE with roadmap check
</preliminary_check>
</conditional_execution>

<conditional_loading>
IF roadmap.md NOT already in context:
USE: mcp__filesystem__read_text_file to read @.agent-os/product/roadmap.md
ELSE:
SKIP loading (use existing context)
</conditional_loading>

<roadmap_criteria>
<update_when> - spec fully implements roadmap feature - all related tasks completed - tests passing
</update_when>
<caution>only mark complete if absolutely certain</caution>
</roadmap_criteria>

<instructions>
  ACTION: First evaluate if roadmap check is needed
  SKIP: If tasks clearly don't complete roadmap items
  CHECK: If roadmap.md already in context
  LOAD: Only if needed and not in context
  EVALUATE: If current spec completes roadmap goals
  UPDATE: Mark roadmap items complete if applicable
  VERIFY: Certainty before marking complete
</instructions>

</step>

<step number="7" name="completion_notification">

### Step 7: Task Completion Notification

Play a system sound to alert the user that tasks are complete.

<notification_command>
afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff
</notification_command>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Play completion sound
  PURPOSE: Alert user that task is complete
</instructions>

</step>

<step number="8" name="completion_summary">

### Step 8: Completion Summary

Create a structured summary message with emojis showing what was done, any issues, testing instructions, and PR link.

<summary_template>

## ‚úÖ What's been done

1. **[FEATURE_1]** - [ONE_SENTENCE_DESCRIPTION]
2. **[FEATURE_2]** - [ONE_SENTENCE_DESCRIPTION]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues encountered

[ONLY_IF_APPLICABLE]

- **[ISSUE_1]** - [DESCRIPTION_AND_REASON]

## üëÄ Ready to test in browser

[ONLY_IF_APPLICABLE]

1. [STEP_1_TO_TEST]
2. [STEP_2_TO_TEST]

## üì¶ Next Steps

Changes are ready for commit.

**Commit Changes:** Run `/commit` to commit the implemented changes locally

**Create Pull Request:** Run `/create-pr` to push changes and create a pull request when ready
</summary_template>

<summary_sections>
<required> - functionality recap - next steps (/commit and /create-pr instructions)
</required>
<conditional> - issues encountered (if any) - testing instructions (if testable in browser)
</conditional>
</summary_sections>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Create comprehensive summary
  INCLUDE: All required sections
  ADD: Conditional sections if applicable
  FORMAT: Use emoji headers for scannability
</instructions>

</step>

</process_flow>

## Error Handling

<error_protocols>
<blocking_issues> - document in tasks.md - mark with ‚ö†Ô∏è emoji - include in summary
</blocking_issues>
<test_failures> - fix before proceeding - never commit broken tests
</test_failures>
<technical_roadblocks> - attempt 3 approaches - document if unresolved - seek user input
</technical_roadblocks>
</error_protocols>

<final_checklist>
<verify> - [ ] Task implementation complete - [ ] All tests passing - [ ] tasks.md updated - [ ] Roadmap checked/updated - [ ] Changes ready for commit - [ ] Summary provided to user with /commit and /create-pr instructions
</verify>
<note>Commit and PR creation now handled by separate /commit and /create-pr commands</note>
</final_checklist>
